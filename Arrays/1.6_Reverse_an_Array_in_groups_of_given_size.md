# 🔄 Reverse Array in Groups

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given an array `arr[]` of positive integers, reverse every sub-array (group) of size `k`.

**Note:**  
If `k` is greater than or equal to the array size, reverse the **entire** array.

## 💡 Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `k = 3`  
**Output:**  
`[3, 2, 1, 5, 4]`  
**Explanation:**  
- First group: `[1, 2, 3]` → reversed to `[3, 2, 1]`  
- Second group: `[4, 5]` → reversed to `[5, 4]`  

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`arr[] = [5, 6, 8, 9]`, `k = 5`  
**Output:**  
`[9, 8, 6, 5]`  
**Explanation:**  
Since `k (5)` ≥ array size `(4)`, we reverse the whole array.

---

## 📏 Constraints
- `1 ≤ arr.size(), k ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5`

---

## 🛠️ Approach

1. **Loop through the array** in steps of `k` elements.
2. For each group:
   - Find the `left` index = start of group.
   - Find the `right` index = `min(start + k - 1, last index)`.
   - Swap elements between `left` and `right` until the group is reversed.
3. Continue until all groups are processed.

## 🧠 Dry Run Example

**Input:** `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `k = 3`  

Step-by-step:
i = 0 → reverse [1, 2, 3] → [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
i = 3 → reverse [4, 5] → [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]

✅ Final Output = `[3, 2, 1, 5, 4]`

---

## ⏳ Time Complexity
- **O(n)** → Every element is visited and swapped at most once.

---

## 💾 Space Complexity
- **O(1)** → No extra space is used, in-place reversal.

---

## 💻 Code Implementation (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseInGroups(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += k) {
            int left = i;
            int right = Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1);
            
            while (left < right) {
                int temp = arr[left];
                arr[left] = arr[right];
                arr[right] = temp;
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
    }
}

✨ Tip: This problem is very common in interviews and tests your ability to handle subarray operations efficiently.
