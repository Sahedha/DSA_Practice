# 🌊 Wave Array

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Accuracy:** 63.69%

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given a **sorted array** `arr[]` of integers.  
Your task is to **arrange the elements into a wave-like form** **in-place**.

A **wave-like array** means:
arr[0] >= arr[1] <= arr[2] >= arr[3] <= arr[4] ...


📌 If multiple wave patterns are possible, choose the **lexicographically smallest** one.

**Note:**
- The input array is already sorted in ascending order.
- The modification must be done **in-place** (no extra array).

## 💡 Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
Explanation:

Swap (1, 2) → [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]

Swap (3, 4) → [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]


**Example 2:**
Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [4, 2, 8, 7, 10, 9]
Explanation:

Swap (2, 4) → [4, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Swap (7, 8) → [4, 2, 8, 7, 9, 10]

Swap (9, 10) → [4, 2, 8, 7, 10, 9]


**Example 3:**
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: Single element → already in wave form.

## 📏 Constraints
- 1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10⁶  
- 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁹

## 🛠️ Approach

Since the array is **already sorted**, the **lexicographically smallest** wave array can be formed by:

1. **Step 1:** Traverse the array from index `1` to `n-1` in steps of `2`.
2. **Step 2:** Swap each pair `(i-1, i)` to satisfy the wave condition:
   - At even indices, element should be **greater than or equal** to the next.
   - At odd indices, element should be **less than or equal** to the next.
3. This ensures:
   - Minimum swaps.
   - Lexicographically smallest order.

## 💻 Code Implementation
```java
class Solution {
    public void sortInWave(int arr[]) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i += 2) {
            // Swap arr[i] with arr[i-1]
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[i - 1];
            arr[i - 1] = temp;
        }
    }
}

⏳ Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n) — Single pass through the array.

Space Complexity: O(1) — In-place swapping.

🧠 Key Takeaways
✅ Sorting is already given → No need to sort again.
✅ Just swap alternate elements to get wave pattern.
✅ This approach gives lexicographically smallest wave array.
