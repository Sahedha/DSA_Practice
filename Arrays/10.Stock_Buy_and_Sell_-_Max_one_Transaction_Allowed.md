# 📈 Stock Buy and Sell – Max One Transaction Allowed

## 📝 Problem Statement  
Given an array `prices[]` of length `n`, representing the prices of the stocks on different days, you need to find the **maximum profit** possible by buying and selling the stock **at most once**.  
Here **one transaction = 1 Buy + 1 Sell**.  
If no profit is possible, return `0`.  

> **Note:** You must buy before you sell.

## 📌 Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`prices = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]`  
**Output:**  
`8`  
**Explanation:**  
- Buy at **day 2** (`price = 1`)  
- Sell at **day 5** (`price = 9`)  
- Profit = `9 - 1 = 8`

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]`  
**Output:**  
`0`  
**Explanation:**  
- Prices are decreasing → No profit possible → Return `0`

---

### Example 3
**Input:**  
`prices = [1, 3, 6, 9, 11]`  
**Output:**  
`10`  
**Explanation:**  
- Buy at `price = 1` (day 1)  
- Sell at `price = 11` (day n)  
- Profit = `11 - 1 = 10`

## 🚀 Approach

### **Idea**
We want to find:
- **Minimum price so far** (for buying)
- **Maximum profit so far** (for selling)

We traverse the array and:
1. Keep track of the smallest price encountered so far → `minPrice`
2. At each day, calculate potential profit: `prices[i] - minPrice`
3. Update maximum profit if the current potential profit is greater.

---

### **Steps**
1. Initialize:
   - `minPrice = prices[0]`
   - `maxProfit = 0`
2. Loop through prices from day 1 to day n:
   - Update `minPrice` if a lower price is found
   - Calculate potential profit
   - Update `maxProfit` if potential profit is higher
3. Return `maxProfit`

---

## 💻 Code (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumProfit(int prices[]) {
        int n = prices.length;
        int minPrice = prices[0];
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, prices[i]);
            res = Math.max(res, prices[i] - minPrice);
        }
        return res;
    }
}


📊 Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) ⏳ (Single pass through the array)

Space Complexity: O(1) 💾 (Only a few variables)

🔑 Key Points
✅ Only one buy-sell allowed

✅ Must buy before selling

✅ Works even if prices are not sorted

✅ If prices only decrease → return 0
