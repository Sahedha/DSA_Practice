## 📌 Problem Statement
Given an array `arr[]` consisting of only **0’s** and **1’s**, return the **count of the maximum number of consecutive 1’s or 0’s** present in the array.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`arr[] = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
The maximum number of consecutive 1’s is **4** from index 3 to 6.  

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`arr[] = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
The maximum number of consecutive 0’s is **2** from index 0 to 1.  

---

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 0]`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
The maximum number of consecutive 0’s is **4**.

---

## 📏 Constraints
- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5`  
- `0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1`

---

## 💡 Approach
We want to find the **longest consecutive streak** of either 0's or 1's.  
Here’s how we can do it:
1. Keep track of the **current count** of consecutive numbers.
2. Compare the **current element** with the **previous element**:
   - If they are the same → increment the count.
   - If they are different → reset count to 1 and check if we found a new maximum.
3. At the end, take the **maximum** between the last streak and the previously stored maximum.

## 🖥 Code Implementation (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxConsecBits(int[] arr) {
        if(arr.length == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        int maxCount = 0, count = 0, prev = -1;

        for(int n : arr){
            if((prev ^ n) == 0){ // Same as previous
                count++;
            } else { // Different from previous
                maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
                count = 1;
            }
            prev = n;
        }
        return Math.max(maxCount, count);
    }
}



⏳ Time Complexity
O(n) → We loop through the array once.

📦 Space Complexity
O(1) → Only a few extra variables used.

Input: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

| Index | Current Element | Previous | Same as Previous? | Count | MaxCount |
| ----- | --------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- | -------- |
| 0     | 0               | -1       | ❌                 | 1     | 0        |
| 1     | 1               | 0        | ❌                 | 1     | 1        |
| 2     | 0               | 1        | ❌                 | 1     | 1        |
| 3     | 1               | 0        | ❌                 | 1     | 1        |
| 4     | 1               | 1        | ✅                 | 2     | 1        |
| 5     | 1               | 1        | ✅                 | 3     | 1        |
| 6     | 1               | 1        | ✅                 | 4     | 1        |


Final Answer: 4

🎯 Key Points
We don’t care if it’s 0 or 1 — we just want the longest streak.

Works in linear time with constant space.

Can handle large arrays (up to 10^5 elements).
