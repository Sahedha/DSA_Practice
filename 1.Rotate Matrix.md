You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.

DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
Example 1.

1 2 3        7 4 1
4 5 6  ==>>  8 5 2
7 8 9        9 6 3
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
Example 2.

5 1 9 11               15 13 2 5
2 4 8 10        ==>>   14 3 4 1
13 3 6 7               12 6 8 9
15 14 12 16            16 7 10 11
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
Constraints:.

n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
1 <= n <= 20
-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000.


Here's an explanation of your **matrix rotation** code, which flips the matrix upside down and then transposes it to achieve a **90-degree clockwise rotation**.

### **Code Explanation**
```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        int edgeLength = matrix.length;
        int top = 0;
        int bottom = edgeLength - 1;

        // Step 1: Vertical Flip (Swap top and bottom rows)
        while (top < bottom) {
            for (int col = 0; col < edgeLength; col++) {
                int temp = matrix[top][col];
                matrix[top][col] = matrix[bottom][col];
                matrix[bottom][col] = temp;
            }
            top++; 
            bottom--;
        }

        // Step 2: Transpose the Matrix (Swap elements across the diagonal)
        for (int row = 0; row < edgeLength; row++) {
            for (int col = row + 1; col < edgeLength; col++) {
                int temp = matrix[row][col];
                matrix[row][col] = matrix[col][row];
                matrix[col][row] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **Detailed Explanation**
1. **Vertical Flip:**  
   - The matrix is flipped **top to bottom** by swapping rows.
   - This moves the first row to the last row, the second row to the second last, and so on.

2. **Transpose the Matrix:**  
   - Swaps elements across the **main diagonal**.
   - Each `matrix[row][col]` is swapped with `matrix[col][row]`, effectively switching rows and columns.

### **Why This Works?**
Instead of doing a standard **rotation**, this method first **flips** the matrix **vertically** and then transposes it. This achieves the same result as a **90-degree clockwise rotation**.

### **Time & Space Complexity Analysis**

#### **Time Complexity:**
Your matrix rotation code consists of two steps:
1. **Vertical Flip:** This swaps rows, requiring **O(NÂ²)** operations (each element is swapped once).
2. **Transpose:** This swaps elements across the diagonal, also **O(NÂ²)**.

Since both operations run in **O(NÂ²)** time, the overall **time complexity is O(NÂ²)**.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- Your code **modifies the matrix in place**, meaning **no extra space** is used.
- Only a few extra variables (`top`, `bottom`, `temp`) are used, which take **O(1) space**.

Thus, **space complexity is O(1)**.
